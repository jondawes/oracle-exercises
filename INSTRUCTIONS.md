# <a id="_background"></a>Background

This guide will get you started with Delphix&#39;s virtualization for Oracle. You will learn how to to securely copy and share datasets. Using virtualization, you will ingest data from sources and create virtual copies, which are full read-write capable database instances that use a small fraction of the resources a normal database copy would require.

Delphix Virtualization's functionality is exposed through two interfaces: management/admin and self-service. Through the management/admin interface (the topic of this guide), DB administrators connect to source datasets and create resources such as virtual databases. Through the self-service interface, non-admin users can operate on data provided by administrators. A guide for self-service can be found <a href="https://github.com/delphix/lab-guides/blob/master/self-service/INSTRUCTIONS.md">here</a>.

We also provide a guide for Delphix <a href="https://github.com/delphix/lab-guides/blob/master/masking/INSTRUCTIONS.md">masking</a>, and for other virtualization data sources such as <a href="https://github.com/delphix/lab-guides/blob/master/mssql-admin/INSTRUCTIONS.md"> MS SQL </a> and <a href="https://github.com/robertodelphix/lab-guides/blob/master/postgresql/instructions.md"> postgresql</a>.

## <a id="_ex1"></a>Exercise 1 – Logging into the Delphix Engine UI

In this exercise, you will:

- Access the Delphix Data Platform GUI as the Delphix admin user
- Access the Delphix Data Platform Setup GUI as the sysadmin user

**Context**

The Delphix virtualization GUI has two layers: management and setup. The management GUI is accessed by admins who control data assets and objects. The setup GUI is controlled by sysadmins who manage the engine and create new admin users.

Alternatively, the engine can be controlled through the [CLI](https://docs.delphix.com/docs/developer-s-guide/command-line-interface-guide/command-line-interface-overview) or [APIs](https://docs.delphix.com/docs/developer-s-guide/web-services-api-guide).

**Steps**

1. Connect to your Delphix Engine using Chrome on your lab server (see the **Important IP Addresses** section of the Getting Started guide above). The IP address will be 10.0.x.10, where &quot;x&quot; is your **Student Number**
2. Login to the Delphix Dynamic Data Platform using the username ***admin*** and password ***delphix***
3. Click **Log In**

## <a id="_ex2"></a>Exercise 2 – Create the &quot;delphix\_db&quot; User

In this exercise, you will:

- Create a Delphix DB User on your source database

**Context**

Delphix requires access to database users with certain privileges. These are configured through automated scripts.

**Steps**

1. Use the **Terminal** app on your Jumpbox desktop to connect into your Linux Source (see the **Important IP Addresses** section of the Getting Started guide above).
   - Type ssh 10.0.x.20 (where &quot;x&quot; is your **Student Number)**
2. Extract the **hostchecker\_linux\_x86.tar** file in your home directory
   - Type ls -ltr
   - Type tar -xvf hostchecker\_linux\_x86.tar
3. Navigate to the hostchecker directory
   - Type cd hostchecker
   - Type ls -ltr (observe the files present in this folder, as we will be using them again)
4. Set the Oracle environment variables below:
   - Type export ORACLE\_HOME=/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/dbhome\_1
   - Type export ORACLE\_SID=orcl
   - Note: &quot;. oraenv&quot; can be used to set the environment variable rather than export commands
5. Run the script to create the delphix\_db user
   - Type ./createDelphixDBUser.sh
6. Use the following details during the running of this script:
   - The user will be created in the default instance **orcl**. This is set by the environment variable ORACLE\_SID. Press **Enter** to accept the default database instance **orcl**
   - Delphix DB User Username:delphix\_db
   - Delphix DB User Password: delphix\_db
   - Decline the SELECT ANY DICTIONARY privilege. This is a sweeping privilege that is not required, but optional
   - Type: n and press **Enter**

     ![](images/new/image5.png)

The script should create the user without error.

<br></br>
## <a id="_ex4"></a>Exercise 4 – Add a Source Environment

In this exercise, you will:

- Connect Delphix to your Source Oracle Database server
- Create a Source Environment

**Context**

Before users can create their own virtual databases, Delphix needs to connect to source data. In Delphix, an environment is a host that runs database software. For example, a Linux system running Oracle. The environment is where the Delphix engine will search for available data sources. Credentials to access the host need to be provided while configuring an environment.

**Steps**

1. Log into the Delphix Data Platform UI as the ***admin*** user and the password that was set during the Engine setup.
   - Note: If you forgot your admin password, please ask your lab administrator to reset it.
2. Click the **Manage** menu and select **Environments** from the list
3. Click the ellipses ( **…** ) next to **Environments** then choose **Add Environment**
4. On the Host and Server select the following:
   - Host OS: **Unix/Linux**
   - Server Type: **Standalone**

     ![](images/new/image8.png)

5. For Environment Settings, provide the following information
   - Environment Name: Source
   - Host Address: ***10.0.x.20*** (&#39;x&#39; will be your **Student Number** )
   - NFS Addresses: ***10.0.x.20*** (&#39;x&#39; will be your **Student Number** )
   - Leave the **DSP** fields blank
   - Set **Login Type** to **Username and Password**
   - OS Username: ***delphix***
   - OS Password: ***delphix*** (Note: Enter the Toolkit Path before Validating the Username and Password)
   - Toolkit Path: /u01/app/toolkit
   - Click **Validate**

     ![](images/new/image9.png)

6. Click **Next**
7. Click **Submit**
8. You can view the status of the environment creation and discovery by clicking on the **Actions** menu on the top right-hand side of the page. Clicking on a job in the Actions pane will allow you to track its progress. 

   ![](images/new/image10.png)

<br></br>
## <a id="_ex5"></a>Exercise 5 – Link a dSource

In this exercise, you will:

- Create an Oracle dSource by syncing with your Source Oracle Database
- Create a Delphix Group to hold your dSource object

**Context**

With an environment set-up, users can then sync databases into Delphix. The Delphix engine will read the source database and create a dSource (a custom object). The dSource is not a functional image of the database but a storage-efficient object from which virtual databases can be created. When creating a dSource, Delphix will pull over the complete data set using standard database protocols. Subsequent sync operations, as governed by user-defined policies, will pull only incremental changes. At the end of each sync operation, a snapshot is created that serves as the base point for provisioning operations. These sync operations are called SnapSync. Additional details on sync functionality can be found [here](https://docs.delphix.com/docs/datasets/getting-started/managing-data-sources-and-syncing-data).

**Steps**

1. View the Environment details
   - Click on the **Environment** on the left on review information on the **Details** tab

5. In the Source tab select the orcl Data source and provide the username and password of the database user (user and password are both ***delphix_db***)
6. Under the **dSource Configuration** tab we will provide a user-friendly name for the dSource and create a new Dataset Group to place it in.
   - Enter ***orcl*** for the **dSource Name**
   - Click on the **Add Dataset Group** link and enter ***Source DB*** in the **Name** field.

     ![](images/new/image14.png)

7. Click **Next**
8. On the **Data Management** tab accept the defaults
   - Initial Load: **Immediately**
   - LogSync: **Enable Archive + Online Redo**
   - Click **Next**

10. Click **Next**
11. Accept defaults for the Hooks. No Hooks will be used.
12. Click **Next**
13. Review the Summary and click **Submit**.

    ![](images/new/image15.png)

14. Wait for the dSource to be created

    ![](images/new/image16.png)

You will know this is successful if the dSource completes in the **Actions** pane without Errors. Click on **Actions** in the top menu bar if you don&#39;t see this pane. Also, the **dSource** state will change to **Active**

<br></br>
## <a id="_ex6"></a>Exercise 6 – Add Target Environments

In this exercise, you will:

- Connect Delphix to your Target Oracle server

**Context**

The target environment is the host where the virtual databases will be created.

## <a id="_ex9"></a>Exercise 9 – Rewind a VDB

In this exercise, you will:

- Take a snapshot of the devdb VDB
- Corrupt the devdb VDB to introduce a bootstrap error
- Rewind the devdb VDB to recover from the error

**Context**

Rewinding a VDB rolls it back to a previous point in its Timeflow and re-provisions the VDB. The VDB will no longer contain changes after the rewind point. it can be triggered when changes to the VDB do not need to be saved.

**Steps**

1. On the Delphix main screen, select the **devdb** VDB
2. Click the **Camera icon** on the top right to take a snapshot of the VDB

   ![](images/new/image30.png)

3. A new snapshot card will be created on the **devdb Timeflow**. Make a note of the date/time for the latest snapshot card.
4. Open Terminal on your Lab Server desktop
   - Type: ssh delphix@10.0.x.30 (&#39;x&#39; will be your **Student Number** )
5. Enter the username: delphix
6. Enter the password: delphix
7. Run the following commands:
   - Type export ORACLE\_SID=devdb
   - Type sqlplus / as sysdba
   - Type delete from sys.obj$;
   - Type commit;
   - Type shutdown abort;
   - Type startup;

     ![](images/new/image31.png)

    - Note that the database is unable to come online due to a bootstrap error. The **devdb** database is now corrupted. Now we will rewind the VDB to the last good snapshot to fix this.

8. In the Delphix Data Platform (web browser), click on the **devdb** VDB if it is not already selected
9. Click on the **Timeflow** tab and select the snapshot associated with the date/time you recorded prior to corrupting your database. This will most likely be the latest snapshot.
10. Hover over the **Snapshot** to reveal the **Rewind** button.
11. Click the **Rewind VDB** button on the **Timeflow**

    ![](images/new/image32.png)

12. Confirm that you wish to rewind the VDB by clicking **Rewind**.

    ![](images/new/image33.png)

Once the rewind operation is complete, you can confirm the rewind was successful by connecting to the server again and querying the database:

13. Open Terminal on your Lab Server desktop
14. Type ssh delphix@10.0.x.30 (&#39;x&#39; will be your **Student Number** )
15. Enter the username: delphix
16. Enter the password: delphix
17. Run the following commands:
    - Type export ORACLE\_HOME=/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/dbhome\_1
    - Type export ORACLE\_SID=devdb
    - Type export PATH=$ORACLE\_HOME/bin:$PATH

## <a id="_ex17"></a>Optional Advanced Exercise – Configure Delphix Replication

Note: This exercise is only possible if your classroom has been configured with 2 or more students.

In this exercise, you will:

- Set up a replication profile
- Replicate your entire Delphix Data Platform to another Delphix Data Platform
- View the replicas in the target Delphix Data Platform

**Steps**

As an advanced exercise, this lab has no corresponding Lab Solution. Instead, we will walk through the steps to get you acquainted the Delphix Replication capability.

1. In the Delphix GUI, select **System** and then **Replication** on the top menu bar
2. Add a **Replication Profile** called DR Replica
   - Click the **plus sign** next to **Replication Profiles** on the top left
   - Enter a **Replica Profile Name** : ***DR Replica***
   - For Target Engine, enter the **Delphix Data Platform IP address** for the next student in your classroom environment. If you are the last student, use the Delphix Data Platform IP address for Student 1. For example, in a class with 3 students:
     - Student 1 Delphix Data Platform is at 10.0.1.10, and they will replicate to 10.0.2.10
     - Student 2 Delphix Data Platform is at 10.0.2.10, and they will replicate to 10.0.3.10
     - Student 3 Delphix Data Platform is at 10.0.3.10, and they will replicate to 10.0.1.10
     - Ask your instructor if you have any questions or confusion about this configuration.
   - Enter the User Name: ***admin***
   - Enter the Password: ***delphix***
   - Do not enable Automatic Replication or configure Traffic Options
   - For the Objects Being Replicated, select: **Entire Delphix Data Platform**
   - Click **Create** at the bottom when ready.

   ![](images/new/image62.png)

3. Start the Replication by clicking the **Replicate Now** button on the top right of your screen.
4. Click **Replicate** to confirm you are ready to begin.
5. Once the initial full replication is complete, you will see a message stating **Last Replication Successful**.

   ![](images/new/image63.png)

6. Check the results on your target Delphix Data Platform
   - In your lab server browser, enter ***the IP address*** you used for the Target Engine in your replica profile. For example, if you are Student 1, your Delphix Data Platform is at 10.0.1.10, and your target would have been 10.0.2.10.
   - Log in as user ***admin*** with the password ***delphix***
   - Observe the dropdown list under **Datasets** on the top left corner of your screen. It should have **Default shown** which is the default **Namespace** for Delphix replica targets.
   - In order to see the replica objects, click on the dropdown list and select the second entry, which should reflect the hostname of the source Delphix Data Platform that sent the replica.

_Note: The hostname shown in the labs is based on the default hostname given to the Delphix Data Platform in Amazon AWS, consisting of the prefix &quot;ip&quot; followed by the IP address separated by hyphens._

7. While still logged into your target Delphix Data Platform, click on **System** and then **Replication**
8. Observe the **Received Replicas** section at the bottom, indicating and verifying the target&#39;s receipt of replication data.
   - Note: The **Failover Now** option will not work for these labs due to namespace collisions. This is an inherent outcome to plan for when using Active/Active replication.
